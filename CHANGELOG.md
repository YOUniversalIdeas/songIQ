### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/songs/upload` - Upload a new song
- `GET /api/songs/:id` - Get song details
- `PUT /api/songs/:id` - Update song information
- `DELETE /api/songs/:id` - Delete a song
- `POST /api/analysis/start/:songId` - Start analysis process
- `GET /api/analysis/status/:songId` - Check analysis progress
- `GET /api/analysis/results/:songId` - Get analysis results
- `GET /api/market/compare/:songId` - Get similar songs and market data
- `GET /api/market/trends/:genre` - Get current genre trends
- `GET /api/market/predictions/:songId` - Get success predictions

### Development Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Start both client and server in development mode
- `npm run build` - Build both client and server for production
- `npm run install:all` - Install all dependencies
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint on both projects
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking

### Known Limitations
- **Mock Data**: Audio analysis and success predictions currently use mock data
- **No Authentication**: User authentication not yet implemented
- **Local Storage**: Files stored locally (not cloud storage)
